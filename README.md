Elections are the most important pillar of democracy and our idea focuses upon revolutionising the entire process of elections beginning from the point of registering for the voter IDs to the process of declaration of results of the elections.
We have focused our attention on making the process of applying for voter IDs more efficient and thus, as a result, apply blockchain to make the process of vote counting instant and thus effectively tackling the EVM hacking accusations. Having a look at the four problems handled:

    1. Applying for Voter’s ID.
    2. The geographical limitations encountered while voting.
    3. EVM Hacking accusation.
    4. Expedite Vote Counting.

We propose a system of voting in which we will be using the existing IDs of the voters (like Driving Licences, Passport, Aadhar etc) which have a biometric link to the identity of the user. Then we use that biometric-identity to generate a unique alpha-numeric code used as an ID for each voter linked through their existing IDs and biometric verification.
Then the registered voter can sign in to the voting website and get an OTP on their registered mobile numbers, and then enter that OTP and vote through a portal, a web app with a simple user-interface which allows them to choose between the different candidates generating a different 'transaction' for each vote which gets added to a block. This also makes the process of vote counting instant and hassle-free thereby tackling all the accusations of EVM fraud and hacking and thus making the process of elections more transparent.
We will be using the following applications in order to build such a system for voting:

    • ReactJS for Front-End.
    • Azure Blockchain for deployment.
    • Solidity for implementation of Smart Contracts.
    • AzureSQL for maintaining user database
